# Creating a React App

To create a new react app it gets as easy as running:
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```
for this all you need is an environment with `Node >= 8.10` and `npm >= 5.6`, 
create-react-app will take care of all dependencies for you(webpack, babel, jest) and create an example app for you to get started.

### Running Dev Server

Once it is installed you can run your dev client server by:
```sh
PORT=<desired-port> yarn start
# you dont have to pass the port and it will run on 3000 by default
```
