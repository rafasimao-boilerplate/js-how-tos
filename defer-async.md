# Diference between Async and Defer

### Async

Is used to download the script file asynchronously, but runs as soon as finishes the download.

### Defer

Is used to download the script file asynchronously and defers the script execution to after the rendering has been concluded, but before the DOMContentLoaded(usually used as event to run an script when page is ready).
